    "Ans - Python code is both compiled and interpreted.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Name a few blocks of code used to define in Python language? \n",
    "Ans - To define a block of code we use indentation. Indentation is the whitespaces at the beginning of the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. State a character used to give single-line comments in Python? \n",
    "Ans - '#' is used to give single-line comments in Python.\n",

    "Ans - Identifier can be of any length.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What are the benefits of using Python? \n",
    "Ans - 1. Easy to code\n",
    "      2. Easy to read\n",
    "      3. Free and Open source\n",
    "      4. Multiple Libraries\n",

    "        \n",
    "14. How is memory managed in Python? \n",
    "Ans - In Python memory allocation and deallocation method is automatic as the Python developers created a garbage collector\n",
    "      for Python so that the user does not have to do manual garbage collection. Garbage collection is a process in which \n",
    "      the interpreter frees up the memory when not in use to make it available for other objects.\n",
    "        \n",
    "15. How to install Python on Windows and set path variables? \n",
    "Ans - Steps for installing Python on Windows:\n",

    "        2. Double click on the downloaded file and install Python for all users, \n",
    "           and ensure that Python is added to your path. Click on Install now to begin.\n",
    "        3. After the installation is complete, click Disable path length limit and then Close.\n",
    "        4. Click Close to end the installation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "      Steps to set windows environmental path:\n",

    "        3. Clicking on the Environment Variables button on the bottom right.\n",
    "        4. In the System variables section, selecting the Path variable and clicking on Edit. \n",
    "           The next screen will show all the directories that are currently a part of the PATH variable.\n",
    "        5. Clicking on New and entering Pythonâ€™s install directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Is indentation required in python? \n",
    "Ans - Indentation is very important in python, python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.\n",
